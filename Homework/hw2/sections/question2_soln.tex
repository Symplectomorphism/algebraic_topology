\question Given positive integers $v$, $e$, and $f$ satisfying $v-e+f=2$,
construct a cell structure on $\mathbb{S}^2$ having $v$ $0$-cells, $e$
$1$-cells, and $f$ $2$-cells.

\begin{solution}
%
Suppose $v=1$. Then $f = 1+e$. Attach the two ends of all $1$-cells to this only
$0$-cell, like a bouquet of circles. Then fill in each circle with $2$-cells.
Then, attach the last $2$-cell to the boundary of the bouquet of circles.

\end{solution}
