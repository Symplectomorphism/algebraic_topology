\begin{parts}

\part Let $X$ be the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ consisting of the horizontal
segment $[0,1] \times \{0\}$ together with all the vertical segments $\{r\}
\times [0, 1-r]$ for $r$ a rational number in $[0, 1]$. Show that $X$
deformation retracts to any point in the segment $[0, 1] \times \{0\}$, but not 
to any other point.

\begin{solution}
    
\end{solution}

\part Let $Y$ be the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that is the union of an infinite 
number of copies of $X$ arranged as in the figure (in the book). Show that $Y$ 
is contractible but does not deformation retract onto any point.

\begin{solution}
    
\end{solution}

\part Let $Z$ be the zigzag subspace of $Y$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$
indicated by the heavier line. Show that there is a deformation retraction in
the weak sense of $Y$ onto $Z$, but no true deformation retraction.
