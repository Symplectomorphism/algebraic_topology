\question Show that if a space $X$ deformation retracts to a point $x \in X$,
then for each neighborhood $U$ of $x \in X$ there exists a neighborhood $V
\subseteq U$ of $x$ such that the inclusion $V \hookrightarrow U$ is
nullhomotopic.


\begin{solution}
    Since $X$ retracts to a point $x \in X$, there is a homotopy $f: X \times I
    \rightarrow X$ with $f_0 = \mathbb{1}_X$ and $f(x,t) = x$ for all $t$. By
    continuity, $f^{-1}(U)$ is an open set for all open sets $U \subseteq X$. In
    other words, for each $t$ there is a neighborhood $V_t \ni x$ and an open
    interval $I_t \ni t$ such that $f(V_t, I_t) \subseteq U$.

    $I$ is compact so there is a finite set of intervals $I_1, \ldots, I_n$,
    covering $I$, with corresponding sets $V_1, \ldots, V_n$ so that $f(V_i
    \times I_i) \subseteq U$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$. 

    Now, set $V = U \cap V_1 \cap \cdots \cap V_n$ and notice that $f(V \times
    I) \subseteq U$ and $f\rvert_{V \times I}$ is a homotopy from $V
    \hookrightarrow U$ to a constant map. \hfill $\blacksquare$
